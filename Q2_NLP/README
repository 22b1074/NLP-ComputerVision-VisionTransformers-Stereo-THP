1) Install libraries required with compatible versions
2)I am splitting text into lines
3)Then storing it in structured data(using  Haystack's InMemoryDocumentStore)under 3 keys like objectives,progress, team_members by seeing a line comes under which section(i wrote up small pdf for this ‘thv.pdf’)
4)Then used TransformerReader(as this is compatible version) to generate answers from above retrieved document
5)Then used pipeline to take query and generate answer based on relevant content in retrieved document
6)For now its working properly , i mean after installing libraries just run Q2_NLP.py file ,it prompts  
‘you: ‘ after sometime and here we can ask query and answer is given in ‘Chatbot: ‘ prompt 
and to stop asking questions we should give query as ‘exit’

For now chatbot is working giving answers but not proper answers need to work on that
